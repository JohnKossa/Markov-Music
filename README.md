# Markov-Music

My attempts at a Markov-Chain music program. Currently, the program accepts no inputs and is just designed to be run as-is either in a browser or Node.js

The Markov chain is memoryless, and I don't think the seeding an rebalancing algorithms are working properly. I suspect they're giving too much weight to the last training fed to the map. I'll correct this at some time in the future.
